This statement would like to describe that the project was done by me and my friends. Through joint planning, shared responsibilities, and continuous communication, we have effectively pooled our resources and ideas to produce a comprehensive and cohesive outcome. Our collaboration involved discussing the ideas and various APIs usages, while ensuring that each member had the opportunity to contribute equally to all aspects of the project. This approach not only enhanced our learning experience but also led to a more robust and innovative solution.
